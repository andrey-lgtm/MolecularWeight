Python program that calculates the molecular weight of a formula. Program should accept a formula in whatever form you choose as input from the user, and should display the molecular weight for that formula. Program must be able to handle formulas that:

- consist of a single element, e.g., He
- consist of a sequence of elements, e.g., H H O	
- contain numeric constants, e.g., H2O    
- contain nested formulas, e.g., (NH4)2SO4    

Program should clearly describe the expected input form so the user can interact effectively.
The periodic table of elements can be found in many sources, incuding numerous Web pages (e.g., www.chemicalelements.com/show/mass.html)
