Python program that calculates the molecular weight of a formula using the periodic table (e.g., www.chemicalelements.com/show/mass.html). Program should accept a formula as input from the user, and should display the molecular weight for that formula. Program must be able to handle formulas that:

- consist of a single element, e.g., He
- consist of a sequence of elements, e.g., H H O	
- contain numeric constants, e.g., H2O    
- contain nested formulas, e.g., (NH4)2SO4    

Program should clearly describe the expected input form so the user can interact effectively.
